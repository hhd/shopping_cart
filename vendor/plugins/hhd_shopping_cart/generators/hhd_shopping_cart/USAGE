Description:
    This will generate a shopping cart within your application. Controllers,
    models views and migrations are entered into your application giving you
    full control to change appearance and functionality, as is often the case
    for bespoke shopping carts. The shopping cart plugin is still required once
    the cart has been generated as it duck punches in acts_as_purchasable and
    purchasable_form_for.

Example:
    ./script/generate hhd_shopping_cart Thing

    This will create:
      app/
        controllers/
          billing_addresses_controller.rb
          orders_controller.rb
          purchases_controller.rb
          shipping_addresses_controller.rb
        models/
          address.rb
          cart_mailer.rb
          order.rb
          purchase.rb
        views/
          billing_addresses
            show.html.erb
