01. Automatic CMS navigation
------------------------------

Implementation
----------------

By default, the navigation in the CMS will be automatically generated. Each subclass of AdminController will
get it's own navigation item. Because most websites will require more complex navigations, there is a bunch of
things you can do.

 a) Prevent navigation for a given controller:

    If your controller does not need navigation, just define the following class method in public scope:

      def self.show_nav?
        false
      end

  b) Show navigation with a different title:

     By default, the template will try and sanitize the controllers name (Admin::ProductsController -> "Products").
     To specify a different name, define the following class method in public scope:

      def self.nav_title
        "Product Catalogue"
      end

  c) Override the nagivation section:

     If you'd like to display something fundamentally different, such as additional navigation items or
     different styles, you can overwrite the section entirely by providing your own partial. I recommend you
     copy the default partial and modify it to suit:

      $ cp ./app/views/admin/_nav.html.erb ./app/views/admin/RESOURCE/


Example
---------

As an example, lets say you have a product catalogue with the two controllers:

  - admin/ProductsController
  - admin/ProductCategoriesController 

You'd like to display the sections like so in the navigation:

  Product Catalogue
    Products
    Categories

To achieve this, I'd suggest the following:

  0) Disable automatic nav generation for the ProductCategoriesController (see section a in 'implementation').
  1) Provide an overriding partial for the ProductsController, by copying the default partial (section c in 'implementation').
     The overriding partial should look something like this:

     <li>
       <span>Product Catalogue</span>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="<%= cms_nav_url(Admin::ProductsController) %>">Products</a></li>
         <li><a href="<%= cms_nav_url(Admin::ProductCategoriesController) %>">Categories</a></li>
       </ul>
     </li>
