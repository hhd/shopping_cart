02. Rich text editor fields
------------------------------

Implementation
----------------

The template ships with TinyMCE installed. In order to display a field in the CMS as a rich-text-editor (WYSIWYG)
you will need to provide just a little bit of configuration (see 'example' section).

By default I have provided some sane defaults in ./config/tiny_mce.yml, but this can be overridden by passing configuration
directly to the uses_tiny_mce method.

For complete documentation and customisations, you should read the official docs: http://github.com/kete/tiny_mce


Example
---------

If you have a ProductsController and you'd like the "description" field to appear as an RTE, you should:

  0) Ensure the "description" field is of type "text" in the database.
  1) Add a call to the "uses_tiny_mce" method into the admin controller. For example:

     class Admin::ProductsController > AdminController
       uses_tiny_mce

       active_scaffold :products do |config|
         # ....
       end
     end

  2) Add the "comments" fields to the columns array in your ActiveScaffold configuration. Also ensure you
     set the form_u for this column to be :text_editor:

     config.columns = [:name, :description]
     config.columns[:description].form_ui = :text_editor

Upon starting the server and creating/editing a product record, the "description" field should appear as a full WYSIWYG editor.
