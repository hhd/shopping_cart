05. Creating a new CMS section
------------------

Implementation
----------------

The template ships with ActiveScaffold, a RoR plugin for creating complex CRUD interfaces.

Furthermore, we've provided a custom RoR generator for creating a new CMS section:

  $ ./script/generate hhd_controller products

The above command will generate the following changes:

  - CREATE app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb (with template for ActiveScaffold controller).file
  - CREATE app/helpers/admin/products_helper.rb
  - CREATE app/views/admin/products
  - ADD route for product resources in config/routes.rb

From here, all you have to do modify the contents of the admin controller. If you want to remove an existing CMS section, just use the destroy script:

  $ ./script/destroy hhd_controller products

For full documentation, see the official ActiveScaffold wiki at: http://wiki.github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold/


Example
---------

If you would like to add a new section to the CMS called Products, here is what you should do:

  0) Generate the model:

     $ ./script/generate model Product name:string price:float

  1) Run migrations:

     $ rake db:migrate

  2) Generate the HHD controller:

     $ ./script/generate hhd_controller Products

  3) Open app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb and modify it (just add the correct columns):

     class Admin::ProductsController < AdminController

       active_scaffold :product do |config|
         config.list.label = "Products"
         config.create.label = "Create Product"
         config.columns = [:name, :price, :updated_at]

         config.columns[:updated_at].options = {:format => "%d/%m/%Y %I:%M%p"}
       end 

     end

  4) Start the server and take a look:

     $ ./script/server
