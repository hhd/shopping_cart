04. Command-line cheatsheet
-----------------------------

This document lists a collection of processes for common command-line tasks related to the HHD Rails template.


Starting work on a new site
---------------------------
This will create a new folder with the blank rails template inside it.

                     Grab the template: thor hhd:rails:new sitename


Starting work on an existing site
---------------------------------
These commands need to be run from your sites directory. A new folder will be
created with the site you want to work on inside it.

             Find the name of the site: thor hhd:git:list
                         Grab the site: thor hhd:git:grab sitename


Saving your work
----------------
These commands need to be run from your site's root top directory. Merging is
made easy by git so you don't ever need to worry about committing or pushing
when someone else is working on the same site.

                     Add all new files: git add .
       Commit to your local repository: git commit -a -m "Your commit message"
       Push your changes to the server: git push origin master


Configuring your site for deployment
------------------------------------
These commands need to be run from your site's root directory. You'll be asked
for some information we need to deploy your site. This information will be
saved in config files within the site.

        Setup app for deployment: rake deploy:setup
           Add any changed files: git add .
                  Commit changes: git commit -a -m "Setup site for deployment"
                    Push changes: git push origin master


Setting up the server to receive your site
------------------------------------------
These commands need to be run from your site's root directory. They will create
the nessisary files on the server. Make sure you've configured your site for
deployment before you try to setup the server.

                Deploying a to preview: cap setup:all
                 Deploying a site live: cap setup:all -S server=production

These commands need to be run from your site's root directory. Make sure you've
set up the server to receive your site before you try to deploy.

           Deploying a site to preview: cap deploy
                 Deploying a site live: cap deploy -S server=production
