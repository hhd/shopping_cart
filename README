== Welcome to a HARD HAT Ruby on Rails application ==


0) Introduction / Setup
-------------------------

This application consists of a bare Rails application with a bunch of things to help get you started quickly.  The philosophy is that you already know what you're doing and no power should be taken away from you. 

To get started (if you've used the "hhd:rails:new" thor task):

  0) Create and populate the database:

     $ rake db:migrate && rake db:seed

  1) Run the server and take a look at http://localhost:3000:

     $ ./script/server

  2) Commit and push your changes (thor task will have already created a remote repository)

     $ git add .
     $ git commit -avm "Initial commit"
     $ git push origin master

For concise documentation, please see ./doc/*
