# HHD Shopping Cart

This plugin will provide you with a generator and some helper methods for creating a shopping cart.


## Example
 
     
     $ ./script/generate hhd_shopping_cart gogoshoppingcart
      
     # app/models/book.rb
     class Book << ActiveRecord::Base
       acts_as_purchasable :name => :title, :price => :points
     end
      
     # app/views/books/show.html.erb
     <% purchasable_form_for @book.to_purchase do |f| %>
       <%= f.text_field :quantity %>
       <%= f.submit "Add to cart" %>
     <% end %>
      
     # app/controllers/admin_controller.rb
     def cms_nav
       [
         ["Orders", [Admin::OrdersController]],
         Admin::AdminsController
       ]
     end
     

## Gochas

1. You must have a route for your purchasable item. Following on from the
example above you should have a route like "map.resources :books" that makes
"books_path" available in your views.

2. The orders admin area will not appear in the navigation unless you've added
it to the cms_nav.

3. After generating the shopping cart you must migrate your database.

4. You've got to type something after the generator or you'll just see the
documentation. The generator doesn't actually use any of it's arguments, it's
just a requirement of rails.
